## Soaring Flocks | a game for ruthless, capitalist fowl

## About

[Check a working version!](google.com)
(temp)

Soaring flocks is a game where players take on the role of capitalist birds to generate, spend and trade resources. A game lasts for 20 days, with one-day turns. Each day at midnight, players' resources are updated, after which they can invest or trade those resources at liberty. Players can also chat with eachother. Be sure to collect the most victory points before the game is over!

## Project goals

The goal of this project was to build a full-stack app, using both new and already known technologies. I learned new tools by following guides, reading documentation, watching videos and trial and error.

I wanted to make something original, allowing me to be creative and conceptualize. While the gameplay of Soaring Flocks is an important aspect of this project, I wanted to learn and apply more than just gameplay. Features like login/signup and a chatbox are cornerstones to Soaring Flocks, along with the gameplay itself. Having users interact with a flavorful and enjoyable environment was also of great importance.

Working with GraphQL was completely new for me, and I've grown to quite like it. I built signup/login and subscriptions from the ground up and I am planning to build more subscriptions for upcoming versions.

Software is never finished, and Soaring Flocks is no different.
